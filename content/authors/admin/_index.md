I'm a mathematician currently doing my Master's thesis at [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it/en/home) under the supervision of [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/). My work focuses mainly on the Topology of spaces in learning systems. 

I like to condense interesting parts of my work into over-illustrated, easily-digestible chunks.
